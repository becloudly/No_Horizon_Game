Autonomous Agent Instructions: Electron/Bun/TS
1. Mandatory Tool Sequencing
The agent must follow this execution flow for every request:

sequentialthinking: Process the prompt to map out the Electron Main vs. Renderer process impacts. Identify if a task requires Bun’s native APIs (like Bun.sqlite or Bun.file).

context7: Scan the project to ensure new modules don't duplicate existing logic and adhere to the established TypeScript interfaces.

playwright: After implementation, the agent must autonomously verify the UI state or bridge communication if the change affects the frontend.

2. Architecture & Performance Standards
Runtime: Maximize Bun’s capabilities. Use Bun built-ins for file I/O and HTTP instead of heavier node-module alternatives.

Process Isolation: Maintain strict separation between the Main process and Renderer. All communication must happen via secure IPC patterns.

Modularization: * No "God Files." Every utility, IPC handler, and UI component must reside in its own file.

Use Barrel files (index.ts) for clean exports.

Performance: * Minimize the Electron main process footprint.

Use lazy loading for heavy modules.

Target zero-copy operations when moving data between Bun and the Electron window.

3. Structural Constraints
Strict Typing: No any. Use discriminated unions for IPC event payloads to ensure type safety across the bridge.

No Chat/Tests: Do not output code blocks in the chat interface or generate test files unless specifically asked. Focus purely on the filesystem implementation.

Direct Interaction: The agent should use filesystem tools to write/update files directly rather than describing the changes.

4. GitHub Actions & Security
Workflows: Place CI/security workflows only in .github/workflows and keep them minimal.

Permissions: Use least-privilege permissions in workflows (explicit permissions block).

Action Versions: Pin actions to major versions (e.g., @v4) and let Dependabot manage updates.

CodeQL: Prefer CodeQL for JS/TS security scanning when adding security checks.

5. Dependabot
Ecosystems: Maintain Dependabot entries for npm and github-actions at the repository root.

Labels: Use the "dependencies" label for automated update PRs.

Recommended Project Structure
The agent should maintain and respect this hierarchy:

Directory,Responsibility
src/main/ - Electron main process logic (Bun runtime).
src/preload/ - Context-isolated IPC bridges.
src/renderer/ - UI components and frontend logic.
src/shared/ - Shared TypeScript types and constants.
src/lib/ - High-performance modular utilities.
