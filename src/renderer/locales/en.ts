No Horizon is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to real people, places, systems, memories, or feelings
is unintentional… or coincidental… or unavoidable… or planned…

This game contains:
- psychological horror
- themes of isolation, perception, and loss of control
- moments that may feel unnecessary
- moments that may feel too long

Some scenes may cause discomfort, unease, or the vague feeling that something was missed.

No Horizon does not guarantees offering clear answers
or a traditional sense of closure.

We recommend taking breaks if you feel overwhelmed.
The game doesn't remind you to do it (because we're lazy developers).

Thank you for reading.
You may proceed when ready.
